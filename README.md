# Money-Tracker

## Description
For this challenge, I was tasked with updating an existing code for a budget tracker app to allow offline access and functionality, making it a progressive web application (PWA). Users are able to add expenses and deposits to their budget with or without internet connection, thanks to the offline functionality provided by IndexedDB. When the application is reconnected to the internet, it will be updated to reflect the changes that the user made when offline. 

Here is the deployed application: http://morning-reef-46715.herokuapp.com/

## Installation
You will need to run `npm init` to install all dependencies, which include Express, Mongoose, Morgan, and Compression (`npm install mongoose express morgan compression`).

## Usage
After installing necessary dependencies, run `npm start` to start the server.

Here is an image of the application:
